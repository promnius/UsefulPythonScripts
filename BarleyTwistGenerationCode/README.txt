Update: a lot of really interesting mathematical revelations came out of this project, but the summation is that a 2D approximation of the cutter/ thing being cut is only useful if the twist rate is VERY low (approaches the case with no twist rate), and that a 4 axis machine doesn't have a way to efficiently machine barley twists using standard tooling and the side of the cutter. Options are as follows: get a barley twist bit (will not cut perfect twists), surface machine the twist (still requires some interesting Gcode generators, since it is an A-Y surface operation, while X,Z follow the profile), or use the side of the cutter to approximate a square twist, and accept that it isn't really square. Only the surface milling option doesn't require a center drill, and even that is only in the RARE case that the twists are far spread out. With a center drill, the curvature is wrong, so there's no way to create round column open center twists without manual cleanup at the end. It's possible a 4th axis CNC could still be used to twist the part while a user scrapes it with a chisel.
